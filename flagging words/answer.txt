sure, so, my name is Joe and I am 27 years old. For the past 5 years, I’ve been working as a business analyst at Company X and Y. I have some background in data analysis, with a degree from University XY. What really got me into the field, though, is the internship I did at Company Z. Throughout my career, I’ve noticed that I’ve always been good with numbers and handling data. For example, when I was working at Company X, I led a project for migrating all operations data to a new data warehousing system to cut down on costs. The new solution was a much better fit for our business, which eventually led to savings of up to $200,000 annually. One quality I don’t like about myself is I get nervous too easily but whatever it happens with everyone I think.
